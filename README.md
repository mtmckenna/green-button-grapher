# Green Button Grapher [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mtmckenna/green-button-grapher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mtmckenna/green-button-grapher)

## What is This Thing

Green Button Grapher parses and charts [Green Button Data](http://www.greenbuttondata.org/).

## How to Use It

First, download your Green Button Data from your power utility company's website. For example, [here are instructions for downloading Green Button Data from PG&E](https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/Using%20Green%20Button%20Download.pdf).

Next, visit the [hosted version of Green Button Grapher on GitHub](https://mtmckenna.github.io/green-button-grapher/) and upload your Green Button file. Your data will then be displayed as a chart. Note that the file is only parsed by your web browser and not sent to a server.
